# Stochastic Growth and Long-Run Risk 


This notebook displays computational results from solving a permanent income model using small noise expansion method {cite:ps}`hansen2021risk`. This model is a version of Friedman's permanent income model, and habit persistence preferences, motivated by {cite:ts}`hansen1999robust`, is considered in computation.

This notebook is mainly for illustration of model specific results. If interested in more general computation details, users can refer to the Computational Details notebook accompanying this notebook.
