# Stochastic Growth and Long-Run Risk 


This notebook serves as an example from {cite:ps}`hansen2021risk`. It displays computational results of a permanent income model. This model is a version of Friedman's permanent income model, where habit persistence preferences, motivated by {cite:ts}`hansen1999robust`, is considered. The model is approximately solved using a small noise expansion technique as in {cite:ts}`lombardouhlig`.

This notebook is mainly for illustration of model specific results. If interested in more general computation details, users can refer to the Computational Details notebook accompanying this notebook.
