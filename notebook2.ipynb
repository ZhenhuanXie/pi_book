    "It turns out that in equilibrium, the deterministic path of $\\log(\\frac{C_t}{Y_t})$ is $\\log(\\frac{C_t}{Y_t}) \\equiv 0$ for any $t$, and the stochastic path oscillate around the deterministic path. This implies that consumption and income have the same deterministic growth rate in equilibrium, which doesn't come as a surprise (as expected from the FOC on investment)."

At that time, we only made use of the law of motion that $Y_t$ and the two components follow to construct IRFs.\n",

How will the \"new\" IRFs look like? We can directly use the `IRF` method of `modelSol` to obtain the results."
